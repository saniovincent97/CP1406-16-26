<h1>CP1406 - 2016 Group Project Plan</h1>
<h2>Group Number 26</h2>
<p><strong>Members: Sanio, Kip, Scott, Aiden</strong></p>
<h2>Goals</h2>
<p>The goal of the website is to get as many people as possible to attend the concerts and also provide a method of entry for members who want to request to join the band. </p>
<h2>Success Evaluation</h2>
<p>To measure the websites success, the number of people that attend the concerts each year must be recorded which can be aided by ticket sales, the sign-up page on the website can also indicate towards how many band members have volunteered for every concert, this is managed by how many members have registered for a position for each concert.</p>
<h2>Target Audience</h2>
<p>Although the concert already has an older audience attending, the target audience for our new website to appeal to would be men and women roughly around the 15 to 30 age range. With this specific target audience in mind for the new website we hope to target a younger audience for future concerts.</p>
