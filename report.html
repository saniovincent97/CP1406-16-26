<h2>PMI</h2>
<p>your group should spend some time reflecting on the process and describe here the Pluses, Minuses and Interesting
    aspects of your teamwork process and result</p>
<p><strong>Pluses: </strong>Our group was of similar age therefore we got along better and made decisions that everyone was happy with.</p>
<p><strong>Minuses: </strong>We could have worked on our Github a lot better and we should've collaborated on our css together so that we didn't run into problems later on</p>
<p><strong>Interesting: </strong> Our group was commited to work at uni during lecture recess fot the planning stage of the assignment so we are really happy with the teams commitment, and the ability to plan things ahead like when kip had to leave early for brisbane so he made arrangments to finish his portion of the work before he left. </p>
